# Homepage

Hi, this is the repository maintaining personal homepage. This website is simple and clean, based on the default theme [Millennial](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Millennial).

## Local Rendering

Some dependencies should be installed first.

```shell
sudo apt-get install ruby-full ruby-bundler
```

Now go into the root directory and run the following command to render the website locally.

```shell
bundle install
bundle update
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
