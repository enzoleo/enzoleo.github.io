This picture was taken at [the University Station, Hong Kong](https://www.google.com/maps/@22.4151924,114.2109759,18z) last year. The University station was reopened after a long period of maintenance.

The past two years have been difficult for everyone, especially for those who came to Hong Kong for study.
