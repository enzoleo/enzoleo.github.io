This picture was taken at [the University Station, Hong Kong](https://www.google.com/maps/@22.4151924,114.2109759,18z) last year. The University station was reopened after a long period of maintenance.

## Peace

The past two years have been difficult for everyone, especially for those who came to Hong Kong for study. What we require was just a quiet office but our life backfired at last. Before the station was destroyed, I went uphill from the University station every morning and went downhill to the station every night. That was already a routine. Honestly, life became quite inconvenient without metro.

The University station was reopened at the end of the year, and the campus returned to peace after a months of turmoil. Unfortunately, the ensuing epidemic disrupted plans of nearly everyone, and a return to nomal life is still far beyond the horizon. A man must keep moving forward, even if he has to carry the burden of difficulties. Usually I don't like this kind of "inspirational" nonsense, but this time let me pretend to inspire myself here.
