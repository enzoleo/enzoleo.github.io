## Broken Thoughts...
When I was a child, I was very font of solving mathematical problems... Those letters, operators and formulae are so charming that I decided to learn more and more things my teachers didn't know. Probably my friends thought I quit and began to learn some fundamental concepts of computer programming because math was no longer attractive to me. That's not true.

There are a lot of children having full marks in math, but very few mathematicians in the world.
