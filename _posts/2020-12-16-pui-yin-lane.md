## Broken Thoughts...
When I was a child, I was very fond of solving mathematical problems... When working out some difficult problems, the sense of accomplishment was incomparable. Precisely because of this, I was always dreaming of becoming an accomplished mathematician. However, there are a lot of children having full marks in math, but very few mathematicians in the world. *Not all dreams can come true*. This is the cruelest fact that has to be accepted.

At the same time, I will never deny that I still have a passion for mathematics. It is indeed very admirable to keep original aspirations and do some solid research that most people do not comprehend, in such impetuous academic area. **Pay respects to all mathematicians**.
